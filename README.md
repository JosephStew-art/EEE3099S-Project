# Line Following Robot - Treasure Hunt Project
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Line Following Robot project, part of our Mechatronics course. In this project, we will be designing, building, and testing an autonomous mobile robot capable of participating in a thrilling "treasure hunt" within a maze. This README will guide you through the project's purpose and objectives.

## Introduction
In our Mechatronics course, we are assigned a unique design problem to provide us with hands-on experience in real-life complex sub-system design. This project focuses on the development of an autonomous mobile robot capable of navigating a maze while following a line and identifying objects placed along its path. By combining the skills we've acquired over previous semesters, especially from the Design Principles course, we aim to create a functional prototype that can successfully complete a "treasure hunt."

## Project Description
In teams of three, our goal is to create an autonomous mobile robot that will participate in a maze-based treasure hunt. The maze contains objects placed at specific distances from a "detect line." The robot starts at the maze's entrance and, upon activation via a switch or button, must autonomously navigate the maze by tracking a line. It needs to identify and record the location of each object in the maze.

Once the robot discovers all the objects within the maze, it will analyze the distances of these objects from their corresponding detect lines. The robot's final objective is to navigate to the object that is positioned closest to its respective detect line.

## Components
Our project involves the following key components:

* Microcontroller
* Line-following sensors
* Object detection sensors
* Motor drivers
* Wheels and motors
* Power source (batteries)
* Chassis and body for the robot
* Maze structure (for testing purposes)

## Design Process
Our approach to designing the line-following robot for the treasure hunt involves the following steps:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Identify and document the functional and technical requirements of the robot, considering its maze navigation, line-following ability, object detection, and decision-making capabilities.

2. **Conceptual Design**: Brainstorm and sketch various design concepts for the robot's chassis, sensor placements, and navigation algorithms.

3. **Component Selection**: Choose the appropriate microcontroller, sensors, motors, and other components based on the project's requirements and budget constraints.

4. **Algorithm Development**: Develop algorithms for line following, object detection, decision-making, and maze navigation. Test and refine these algorithms in simulation if possible.

5. **Prototyping**: Build a physical prototype of the robot based on the chosen design. Assemble the components, integrate the sensors, and establish the basic control logic.

## Implementation
We will implement our robot using the following steps:

1. Set up the microcontroller and install any necessary libraries or software.

2. Assemble the chassis, wheels, and motors to create the physical structure of the robot.

3. Install and calibrate the line-following sensors to ensure accurate tracking.

4. Integrate the object detection sensors and establish communication with the microcontroller.

5. Develop and upload the algorithmic code for line following, object detection, and maze navigation.

6. Test the robot in controlled environments, making necessary adjustments to the code and hardware.

## Testing and Results
Our testing phase will include:

1. Line Following Test: Assess the robot's ability to accurately follow a designated line on various surfaces.

2. Object Detection Test: Verify the robot's capability to identify objects placed along the maze.

3. Maze Navigation Test: Evaluate the robot's performance in autonomously navigating the maze and reaching the objects.

4. Decision-Making Test: Test the robot's decision-making process for choosing the object closest to the detect line.
